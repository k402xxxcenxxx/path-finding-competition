# How to Participate

To participate in the Path-Finding Algorithm Competition, you should submit an algorithm in a Python file named `plaza_algorithm.py`. This file should contain your `class PlazaAlgorithm`, which will be imported and tested on the competition platform.

Please follow these steps:

1. **Implement the `PlazaAlgorithm` Class:**
   - Your `plaza_algorithm.py` file should define a `class PlazaAlgorithm`.
   - The `PlazaAlgorithm` class should include the necessary methods to handle path-finding and item purchasing tasks.

3. **Check the "Data" Page:**
    - Visit the "Data" page for information on the simple map, hard map, and item list. These datasets are crucial for developing and testing your algorithm.

4. **Refer to the "Seed" Page:**
    - The "Seed" page provides an outline of the PlazaAlgorithm class, including the expected function names and their purposes. Make sure to adhere to this structure for compatibility with the competition's testing framework.

5. **Review the "Timeline" Page:**
    - The "Timeline" page contains important dates and details about the different phases of the competition. Make sure to stay updated on deadlines for submissions and phase transitions.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that your submission meets the competition requirements and can be properly evaluated.

Good luck, and happy coding!
