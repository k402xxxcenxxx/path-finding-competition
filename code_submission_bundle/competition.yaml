    name: Path-Finding Development Task
    description: >
      Tune algorithms on the provided development dataset.
      The dataset includes a simple map and an item list with attributes
      and locations that the robot needs to navigate to and buy items.

    name: Path-Finding Final Task
    description: >
      Train algorithms with the development dataset and test against an unseen final dataset.
      The final dataset includes a hard map and a different item list with attributes
      and locations that the robot needs to navigate to and buy items.
